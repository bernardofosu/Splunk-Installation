INVESTIGATE INTERNAL LOGS

Use btool to troubleshoot configurations
Summary of btool Commands
- **btool list:** Lists configuration settings from specified configuration files.
- **btool check:** Checks for errors in configuration files.
- **btool reset:** Clears the btool cache.
- **btool help:** Not available, but you can check the Splunk documentation for details.

## Splunk's btool is a command-line utility that allows you to view, troubleshoot, and verify configuration settings across various configuration files. Here are some helpful btool commands for common troubleshooting tasks:


## Review the merged settings for a conf file
- You might want to see all input configurations on the forwarder. Using a shell prompt, go to the folder $SPLUNK_HOME/bin in *nix or %SPLUNK_HOME%\bin in Windows. Run the following command: splunk btool <conf_file_prefix> list
```bash
./splunk btool inputs list
```

## Review the merged settings for a conf file in an app context
You might want to see all input configurations contained in the search app on the forwarder.
Using a shell prompt, go to the folder $SPLUNK_HOME/bin in *nix. Run the following command: splunk btool --app=<app> <conf_file_prefix> list
```bash
./splunk btool --app=search inputs list
```

## Review the settings for a conf file and see where the settings are merged from
You might want to see all input configurations on the forwarder and in what context they are set.

Using a shell prompt, go to the folder $SPLUNK_HOME/bin in *nix. Run the following command: splunk btool <conf_file_prefix> list --debug
### View All Settings in a Specific Configuration File
#### Example for inputs.conf:
```bash
./splunk btool inputs list --debug
```
The **--debug** option shows the full file path of each setting, which is useful for identifying where settings are defined or overridden. 

## Review the settings for a conf file and see where the settings are merged from in an app context
You might want to see all props configurations set in the search app on the forwarder, and in what context they are set.
Using a shell prompt, go to the folder $SPLUNK_HOME/bin in *nix. Run the following command: splunk btool <conf_file_prefix> list --app=<app> --debug
### View All Settings in a Specific Configuration File
#### Example for inputs.conf:
```bash
./splunk btool props list --app=search --debug
```


### Display Active Settings for a Specific Stanza
```bash
./splunk btool outputs list default --debug
```
This will display the configuration settings for the default stanza in outputs.conf. (Not working)

### Check Specific Configuration Across All Configuration Layers
#### Example to check the index setting in inputs.conf: (Not working)
```bash
./splunk btool inputs list index --debug
```

#### Validate Configuration Files
```bash
./splunk btool check
```
This command will scan all configuration files for syntax errors and issues, helping you quickly identify misconfigurations.

### Compare Configuration Files Across Layers
#### To see how settings differ across app directories and layers:
```bash
./splunk btool <conf_file> list --debug
```
This shows where each setting is loaded from (system/local, etc/apps, etc.).

### Get Help for a Specific Command
```bash

```
This lists out options and usage for btool, providing quick assistance for command syntax.

### Export Configuration Output to a File
```bash
splunk btool <conf_file> list --debug > /path/to/output.txt
```
Useful for saving configurations to analyze later or share with support teams.


### Common Use Cases
#### Check Active Indexes:
```bash
splunk btool indexes list --debug
```
#### View Forwarder Outputs:
```bash
splunk btool outputs list --debug
```
#### Inspect Deployment Apps:
```bash
splunk btool deploymentclient list --debug
```
# Using the tail command
```bash
tail -10 splunkd.log
```
This will display the last 10 lines of the splunkd.log file.
Explanation

- **tail:** This command reads the end of a file.
- **-10:** Specifies the number of lines to display. Here, -10 tells tail to output the last 10 lines of splunkd.log.
- **splunkd.log:** The file you’re examining; in this case, Splunk’s main log file, which is located by default at $SPLUNK_HOME/var/log/splunk/splunkd.log.

This command is helpful for checking the most recent log entries, such as after a restart or when troubleshooting new issues. If you want to continuously monitor the file, you could use tail -f splunkd.log instead, which will display new lines as they’re added to the log.
# Using btool and grep command
Using grep with btool can make it easier to filter specific settings within Splunk configuration files. Here are examples that combine btool commands with grep to focus on particular keywords or settings:

## Search for a Specific Setting Across All Configurations
### Example to find all occurrences of disabled in inputs.conf:
```bash
splunk btool inputs list --debug | grep "disabled"
```
### Filter Settings by a Specific Stanza
```bash
splunk btool <conf_file> list <stanza_name> --debug | grep "<keyword>"
```
Example to check for index settings within a particular stanza in props.conf:

### Check Multiple Settings in a Configuration File
#### Example for finding both disabled and index in inputs.conf:
```bash
splunk btool inputs list --debug | grep -e "disabled" -e "index"
```
The -e option in grep is used to specify multiple patterns to search for in the output. When you use -e with grep, you can add multiple expressions or keywords to search for in a single command. Each -e option is followed by a separate search term.
Breakdown of the Command

- splunk btool inputs list --debug:
This part of the command uses btool to list out the active configurations in the inputs.conf file, showing each configuration line, its resolved setting, and the source of each setting due to the --debug flag.

- | (pipe):
        This passes the output of the btool command to the grep command, allowing you to filter the btool output.

- grep -e "disabled" -e "index":
        -e "disabled": This specifies that grep should search for lines containing the word disabled.
        -e "index": This specifies that grep should also search for lines containing the word index.

- By using -e twice, you’re effectively telling grep to search for either of these patterns. The result will show all lines that contain either "disabled" or "index" in the output of btool.

##### When to Use -e with grep
The -e option is helpful when you want to search for multiple terms in a single command without needing complex regular expressions. It acts as an "OR" filter, displaying lines that match any of the specified patterns.

### Find All Configurations Set at the Local Level
#### Sometimes, you only want to see configurations applied at the local level. To do this, filter with grep for local:
```bash
splunk btool props list --debug | grep "local"
```
### Check for Specific Ports in outputs.conf
#### Useful for finding forwarding configurations with particular port numbers:
```bash
splunk btool outputs list --debug | grep "9997"
```
### Combine with awk to Display Only Value Columns (Optional)
For example, to see only paths of configuration files for disabled settings:
```bash
splunk btool inputs list --debug | grep "disabled" | awk '{print $NF}'
```
#### Explanation of Each Part
- **splunk btool inputs list --debug:**
This runs btool on the inputs.conf configurations, listing all active settings in the inputs.conf file, with the --debug flag showing the source file and line number for each configuration. The command effectively lists all settings related to data inputs (e.g., monitor, TCP/UDP inputs) configured in Splunk.

- **| (pipe):**
The pipe symbol takes the output of the btool command and passes it to grep.

- **grep "disabled":**
This filters the output to show only the lines containing the word "disabled". In Splunk configurations, the disabled setting (set to either **true or false**) specifies whether a particular input is enabled or disabled.

- **| awk '{print $NF}':**
This uses awk, a text-processing tool, to manipulate the filtered output from grep. **\$NF** is an **awk** variable that refers to the **"last field"** in each line (the value of the last column).In this case, $NF will print only the last word on each line, which is typically the value associated with disabled (often true or false).

#### Example Workflow
Assuming an example output from btool as:
```bash
disabled = true
disabled = false
disabled = true
```
The command will output:
```bash
true
false
true
```
This command finds all disabled settings in inputs.conf and shows only the value of disabled for each line, allowing quick verification of which inputs are enabled (false) or disabled (true).

### Save Filtered Output to a File for Later Review
To save specific configuration output for analysis:
```bash
splunk btool inputs list --debug | grep "index" > /path/to/output.txt
```

# Debuging Splunk Internal Logs
Splunk’s internal logs are invaluable for debugging issues with configurations, performance, connectivity, and more. These logs provide details about internal processes and can be accessed either through the command line or directly within the Splunk Web UI. Here’s a guide on which logs to check and how to filter them for effective troubleshooting:
## Key Splunk Internal Logs for Debugging
- **splunkd.log** – The primary log for the Splunk daemon, including errors, warnings, info, and debug messages.
- **metrics.log** – Provides performance and resource usage metrics, such as CPU and memory usage.
scheduler.log – Logs scheduled search executions, delays, and errors.
- **audit.log** – Logs changes to configurations and settings.
- **web_service.log** – Contains information about Splunk Web UI activities and access.
- **btool** – Although not a log file, using btool can help diagnose configuration issues alongside the logs.
  
## These logs are located in:
```bash
$SPLUNK_HOME/var/log/splunk/
```
# Common Debugging Use Cases
## Search for Specific Errors in splunkd.log
```bash
grep -i "error" $SPLUNK_HOME/var/log/splunk/splunkd.log
```
This command filters for lines containing “error” to identify specific issues.

## Check for Warnings or Connectivity Issues
```bash
grep -i "warn" $SPLUNK_HOME/var/log/splunk/splunkd.log
grep -i "connect" $SPLUNK_HOME/var/log/splunk/splunkd.log
```
The **-i** option in grep makes the search case-insensitive.
This means it will match both uppercase and lowercase variations of the search term (e.g., "Error", "ERROR", "error").

Useful for identifying warning messages or connectivity problems, such as with forwarders or indexers.

## Monitor Resource Usage in metrics.log
```bash
grep "group=" $SPLUNK_HOME/var/log/splunk/metrics.log | grep "cpu" -A 5
```
This command helps you find CPU usage stats to troubleshoot performance issues.

## Review Configuration Changes in audit.log
```bash
grep -i "config" $SPLUNK_HOME/var/log/splunk/audit.log
```
Useful for tracking recent changes to configurations, such as modifications to .conf files

## View Web Access and UI Issues in web_service.log
```bash
grep -i "error" $SPLUNK_HOME/var/log/splunk/scheduler.log
```
Finds errors related to scheduled search executions, such as resource or timing conflicts.

# Using Splunk Web to Access Logs and Deburging
## Access Internal Logs via Search:
### In the search bar, use:
```bash
index=_internal sourcetype=splunkd
```
### Filter by specific log levels:
```bash
index=_internal sourcetype=splunkd log_level=ERROR
```
## Monitoring Console:
```bash
Settings > Monitoring Console.
```
This area provides pre-built dashboards for resource usage, indexing performance, and search health.

# Example Script to Tail Logs with grep
## If you need a script that tails the logs and highlights errors in real time:

# Alternatively you can use the find method 
```bash
find /opt/splunk/etc -name deploymentclient.conf
/opt/splunk/etc/deployment-apps/all_deploymentclient_apps/local/deploymentclient.conf
```
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Tail multiple Splunk logs for real-time error monitoring
tail -f $SPLUNK_HOME/var/log/splunk/splunkd.log \
         $SPLUNK_HOME/var/log/splunk/metrics.log \
         $SPLUNK_HOME/var/log/splunk/audit.log | grep --line-buffered -i "error\|warn\|fail"
```
This script is a bash script for real-time monitoring of multiple Splunk logs, specifically looking for entries that contain keywords like "error," "warn," or "fail." Here’s an explanation of each part of the script:

### Explanation of Each Part
**#!/bin/bash:**
This specifies that the script should be run using the bash shell.

**tail -f $SPLUNK_HOME/var/log/splunk/splunkd.log ...:** The **tail -f** command is used here to monitor multiple log files simultaneously for new entries as they are added.
        Each file (splunkd.log, metrics.log, audit.log) will display new log entries in real time.

**| grep --line-buffered -i "error\|warn\|fail":** **|:** The pipe operator sends the output from tail to grep for further filtering.

**grep --line-buffered:**
The --line-buffered option ensures that grep outputs each matching line immediately, which is essential in a real-time monitoring setup.
        
**-i:** This makes grep case-insensitive, so it will catch "Error," "error," "Warn," etc "error\|warn\|fail":

The **\|** characters create an OR condition in grep, matching any line containing "error," "warn," or "fail" in any case.

## Use Case
### This script is useful for Splunk administrators who want to:
Monitor multiple logs at once, especially for identifying issues in real-time. Filter important log events such as errors, warnings, or failures as they occur across different Splunk logs.

### Running the Script
To run this script:

Save it as monitor_splunk_logs.sh.
    Ensure it has execute permissions:
```bash
chmod +x monitor_splunk_logs.sh
```
### Run it:
```bash
./monitor_splunk_logs.sh
```
This setup allows for continuous log monitoring and quick identification of potential issues by highlighting critical log messages across various Splunk logs.


# Splunkd 
The splunkd process is the core engine of Splunk, responsible for the majority of Splunk's functionality, including data indexing, search, and event processing. It is essentially the main daemon process in Splunk Enterprise and is integral to both managing and running Splunk as a whole. Here’s a breakdown of its primary functions and why it’s so central to Splunk’s operations:
Key Functions of splunkd

## Data Collection and Ingestion:
splunkd collects data from various sources, such as log files, network data, and APIs, which are then ingested into Splunk. This data is parsed, timestamped, and organized into events. It’s responsible for assigning sourcetypes, routing data to different indexes, and ensuring that data is processed according to the configurations in props.conf, transforms.conf, and inputs.conf.

## Data Indexing:
After data ingestion, splunkd indexes the data, making it searchable. This process involves breaking down data into events, compressing it, and storing it in index files on disk. Indexing allows Splunk to retrieve and search through data at high speed, with the help of indexers that store, retrieve, and maintain event metadata.

# Handling and Processing Searches: splunkd is responsible for running search queries (written in Search Processing Language or SPL) submitted by users. This includes handling distributed searches across multiple indexers in larger environments. It manages search jobs, handles dispatch directories, and optimizes queries for efficient processing, providing users with fast access to their data.

## Managing User Sessions and Authentication:
splunkd also manages user authentication, sessions, and role-based access control. This ensures that users have appropriate access to data and that their permissions are respected within the Splunk environment.

## Configuration Management:
splunkd reads configuration files and applies settings as specified. This includes various conf files like inputs.conf, outputs.conf, props.conf, etc., allowing it to adjust its behavior and data processing based on specific settings.

# REST API:
splunkd provides a REST API that allows external applications, scripts, and services to interact with Splunk programmatically. This API supports a wide range of functions, from managing configurations and retrieving search results to controlling Splunk’s services.
This API is crucial for integrations, automation, and customizing Splunk’s behavior in more complex IT environments.

## Components Managed by splunkd
- Search Head: splunkd on the search head is responsible for processing and coordinating searches, as well as displaying results in the UI.
- Indexer: On the indexer, splunkd focuses on indexing data and responding to search requests from the search head.
- Forwarder: On a forwarder, splunkd handles data collection and forwarding to indexers for centralized storage and analysis.

# Troubleshooting and Monitoring splunkd
The primary logs for splunkd include splunkd.log, metrics.log, scheduler.log, and other internal logs. These logs help diagnose performance issues, configuration errors, and other operational problems. Monitoring splunkd is essential to ensure that indexing, data forwarding, and search operations are running smoothly. Performance can be tuned by adjusting settings in configuration files or scaling hardware resources if needed.

## Conclusion
Splunkd is the backbone of the Splunk platform, providing the core functionality that makes Splunk a powerful tool for data analysis and management. Its robust handling of data collection, indexing, search, and user management makes it a critical component in IT environments where real-time data insight is crucial.


# What the btool command can't do

## Here are some limitations to btool:
- The btool command only accepts one conf file at a time for analysis. See List of configuration files in the Admin Manual. To search for configurations across multiple conf files, use your operating system's search tool.
- If the user running btool does not have read access to a conf file due to permission issues, the settings in those files are not shown in the report.
- The switch btool --app does not consider metadata inheritance, and misreports settings that are inherited from other apps.
- The switch btool --user must be used with switch btool --app. If a user is set, an app context must also be set.
- The switch btool --user does not consider knowledge object permissions when evaluating the user.
